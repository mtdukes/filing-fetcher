# Filing fetcher
Automatically grab FCC political filings from a defined list of stations.

Eventually, this might look something like:
> Feed in station list
> Start app
> Monitor station political filing RSS
> Check for existing political file in storage location
> Upload new political file to storage location
> Upload to DocumentCloud?
> Update log/database
