# Filing fetcher
Automatically grab FCC political filings from a defined list of stations.

Eventually, this might look something like:
1. Feed in station list
2. Start app
3. Monitor station political filing RSS
4. Check for existing political file in storage location
5. Upload new political file to storage location
6. Upload to DocumentCloud?
7. Update log/database
